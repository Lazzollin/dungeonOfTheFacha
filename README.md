### The Facha is so Facha that his on a journey to find the golden Tula, because he can, hi's THE FACHA


### Setup guide ðŸ˜Ž

#### Requirements:

* Node JS
* A Discord server (Or at least moderator permissions on one)
* A computer with somewhat stable internet (not my case)
* 10 ~ 25 minutes

First go to [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a **New Application**.

Once you have your app created go to the **0Auth2** tab, on scopes select **"bot"** and on bot permissions select **"Administrator"**, you'll end up with a link like this 'https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=(your_bot_ID)&permissions=8&scope=bot'.
