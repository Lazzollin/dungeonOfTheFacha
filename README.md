### Setup guide ðŸ˜Ž

#### Requirements:

* [<img src="https://sdtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1_tfZa4vsI6UusJYt_fzvGnQ.png" width="16" height="16" />](https://nodejs.org/en/) Node JS
* <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/sanicman/images/c/ca/Concours-discord-cartes-voeux-fortnite-france-6.png/revision/latest?cb=20191015023221" width="16" height="16" /> A Discord server (Or at least moderator permissions on one)
* ðŸ’» A computer with somewhat stable internet (not my case)
* âŒš 10 ~ 25 minutes

* I - Create a discord bot

  First go to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a **New Application**.

  Once you have your app created go to the **0Auth2** tab, on scopes select **"bot"** and on bot permissions select **"Administrator"**, you'll end up with a link like this 'https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=(your_bot_ID)&permissions=8&scope=bot'.

  Now you can copy that link and paste it on your browser and add your new bot to a server.

* II - Server setup

  Dungeon of the Facha uses custom server emojis as textures, so you'll need to add them to your server, to do that go to the **server settings**, click on **"Emoji"** and then **"Upload Emoji"** (You need at least **_18_** available emoji slots), navigate to the game folder, then go to textures and select all the images (you can see all the initial concepts of the levels on the concepts lvl (don't add those as emojis))
