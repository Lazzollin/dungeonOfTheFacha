#### Requirements:

* [<img src="https://sdtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1_tfZa4vsI6UusJYt_fzvGnQ.png" width="16" height="16" />](https://nodejs.org/en/) Node JS
* <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/sanicman/images/c/ca/Concours-discord-cartes-voeux-fortnite-france-6.png/revision/latest?cb=20191015023221" width="16" height="16" /> A Discord server (Or at least moderator permissions on one)
* A computer with somewhat stable internet (not my case)
* 10 ~ 25 minutes

First go to [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a **New Application**.

Once you have your app created go to the **0Auth2** tab, on scopes select **"bot"** and on bot permissions select **"Administrator"**, you'll end up with a link like this 'https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=(your_bot_ID)&permissions=8&scope=bot'.
